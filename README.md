# C Language Programs Repository

Welcome to my C Programming Repository! 👨‍💻  
This repository contains a collection of C language programs, examples, and mini-projects written for practice, learning, and reference.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the topic or purpose of the code. Examples of categories may include:

- `basics/` – Simple programs to understand syntax, data types, operators, etc.
- `control_structures/` – If-else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while)
- `functions/` – User-defined and library functions
- `arrays_strings/` – Programs related to arrays, strings, and their manipulations
- `pointers/` – Concepts and use of pointers
- `structures_unions/` – Programs using structures and unions
- `file_handling/` – Read/write operations on files
- `projects/` – Mini-projects or more advanced C programs

## 🛠 Requirements

To compile and run the programs, you need a C compiler installed. Common options include:

- GCC (Linux/macOS/Windows via MinGW)
- Clang
- Turbo C (for legacy support)

### Example (using GCC):
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
